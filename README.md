# Q_learning
This repository contains the code and files for implementing Q-learning using the Bellman equation. The purpose of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning agent that can learn optimal policies in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment.

**Project Overview**

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that enables an agent to learn optimal actions in an environment through exploration and exploitation. It uses the Bellman equation to iteratively update the Q-values, which represent the expected future rewards for taking a particular action in a given state.

The main steps involved in the project are as follows:

1- Environment Setup: Define the MDP environment, which includes the states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities. This environment serves as the learning environment for the agent.

2- Q-Table Initialization: Create a Q-table to store the Q-values for each state-action pair. Initialize the Q-values with arbitrary values or zeros.

3- Exploration and Exploitation: Implement the Q-learning algorithm, which alternates between exploration and exploitation. During exploration, the agent selects actions randomly to gather experience. During exploitation, the agent chooses actions based on the learned Q-values.

4- Q-Value Update: Apply the Bellman equation to update the Q-values based on the observed rewards and transitions. This update step ensures that the agent gradually learns the optimal Q-values for each state-action pair.

5- Learning Iterations: Repeat the exploration and exploitation steps iteratively to allow the agent to learn from experience and improve the Q-values.

6- Evaluation: Assess the performance of the learned Q-values by measuring the agent's ability to make optimal decisions in the environment. Evaluate metrics such as total reward, convergence, and policy stability.

**Getting Started**

To get started with Q-learning using the Bellman equation, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files.

2- Open the Q-learning code in your preferred programming environment.

3- Set up the MDP environment by defining the states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities. You may use the provided example or customize it for your specific application.

4- Initialize the Q-table with initial Q-values.

5- Implement the Q-learning algorithm, which involves exploration, exploitation, and Q-value updates using the Bellman equation.

6- Run the Q-learning process for a specified number of iterations or until convergence criteria are met.

7-Evaluate the performance of the learned Q-values by measuring the agent's ability to make optimal decisions in the environment. Use metrics such as total reward or policy convergence to assess the quality of the learned policy.



**Documentation**


The following packages are required to run the code:

1) numpy
2) matplotlib (for visualization)

These can be installed using pip:

'pip install numpy, matplotlib'

**Usage**

To run the Q-learning algorithm, simply run the q_learning.py script:

'python q_learning.py'

This will train the agent for a fixed number of episodes and output a plot of the reward history. Algorithm Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an optimal policy by iteratively updating a Q-value function. The Q-value function represents the expected reward for taking a particular action in a particular state. 

In this implementation, we consider a 2D grid with one goal state and one obstacle state. The agent can take one of four actions in each state: up, down, left, or right. The Q-value function is represented as a matrix where the rows correspond to states and the columns correspond to actions.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1- Initialize the Q-value function randomly.

2- For each episode:

  2-1) Initialize the agent in a random starting state.

  2-2) While the agent has not reached the goal state:

        2-2-1) Choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy based on the Q-value function.
        
        2-2-2)Take the chosen action and observe the reward and new state.
        
        2-2-3)Update the Q-value function using the Bellman equation:
        
        2-2-4)Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + alpha * (r + gamma * max(Q(s', a')) - Q(s, a))
        
        2-2-5)Update the current state to the new state.
        
  2-3) Update the epsilon value (for the epsilon-greedy policy).
  
  2-4) Record the total reward for the episode.

  2-5) Plot the reward history over all episodes.

**Parameters**

The following parameters can be adjusted in the q_learning.py script:

1- num_episodes: The number of episodes to train for.

2- alpha: The learning rate (i.e., the step size for updates).

3- gamma: The discount factor (i.e., the weight given to future rewards).

4- epsilon: The probability of choosing a random action (as opposed to the greedy action) in the epsilon-greedy policy.

**Results

After training, the agent should have learned an optimal policy for navigating the grid and reaching the goal state. The reward history plot should show a gradual increase in total reward over episodes.

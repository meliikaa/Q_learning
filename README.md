# Q_learning
This repository contains the code and files for implementing Q-learning using the Bellman equation. The purpose of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning agent that can learn optimal policies in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) environment.

**Project Overview**

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that enables an agent to learn optimal actions in an environment through exploration and exploitation. It uses the Bellman equation to iteratively update the Q-values, which represent the expected future rewards for taking a particular action in a given state.

The main steps involved in the project are as follows:

1- Environment Setup: Define the MDP environment, which includes the states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities. This environment serves as the learning environment for the agent.

2- Q-Table Initialization: Create a Q-table to store the Q-values for each state-action pair. Initialize the Q-values with arbitrary values or zeros.

3- Exploration and Exploitation: Implement the Q-learning algorithm, which alternates between exploration and exploitation. During exploration, the agent selects actions randomly to gather experience. During exploitation, the agent chooses actions based on the learned Q-values.

4- Q-Value Update: Apply the Bellman equation to update the Q-values based on the observed rewards and transitions. This update step ensures that the agent gradually learns the optimal Q-values for each state-action pair.

5- Learning Iterations: Repeat the exploration and exploitation steps iteratively to allow the agent to learn from experience and improve the Q-values.

6- Evaluation: Assess the performance of the learned Q-values by measuring the agent's ability to make optimal decisions in the environment. Evaluate metrics such as total reward, convergence, and policy stability.

**Getting Started**

To get started with Q-learning using the Bellman equation, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository to your local machine or download the code files.

2- Open the Q-learning code in your preferred programming environment.

3- Set up the MDP environment by defining the states, actions, rewards, and transition probabilities. You may use the provided example or customize it for your specific application.

4- Initialize the Q-table with initial Q-values.

5- Implement the Q-learning algorithm, which involves exploration, exploitation, and Q-value updates using the Bellman equation.

6- Run the Q-learning process for a specified number of iterations or until convergence criteria are met.

7-Evaluate the performance of the learned Q-values by measuring the agent's ability to make optimal decisions in the environment. Use metrics such as total reward or policy convergence to assess the quality of the learned policy.
